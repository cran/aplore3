This package is a 'unofficial' companion to the textbook [Applied Logistic
Regression (3rd ed., 2013)](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470582472.html) by D.W. Hosmer, S. Lemeshow and
R.X. Sturdivant (3rd ed.).

It includes all the datasets used in the book, both for easy reproducibility
(assuming a didactic point of view) and algorithms benchmarking purposes.

Some analysis proposed in the text are reproduced in the examples,
in order to provide data testing and code demos at the same time.

The vignette includes all the examples (with graphics too); therefore is
organized per-dataset.

Datasets and variables have lower-case name with respect to the
original sources. Categorical data were packaged as factor.

Regarding data coding, help pages lists the internal/factor representation
of the data (eg 1: No, 2: Yes), not the original one (eg 0: No, 1:
Yes). This is intended to allow easier/safer recoding based on
as.integer, especially for multinomial variables.
